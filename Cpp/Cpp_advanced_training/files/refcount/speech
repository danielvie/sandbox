Blood, toil, tears and sweat

Excerpt from the speech delivered in the House of Commons
in Westminster on 13 May 1940 by Sir Winston Churchill

Sir, to form an Administration of this scale and complexity
is a serious undertaking in itself,
but it must be remembered that we are in the preliminary stage
of one of the greatest battles in history,
that we are in action at many points in Norway and in Holland,
that we have to be prepared in the Mediterranean,
that the air battle is continuous
and that many preparations have to be made here at home.
In this crisis I hope I may be pardoned
if I do not address the House at any length today.
I hope that any of my friends and colleagues,
or former colleagues,
who are affected by the political reconstruction,
will make all allowances for any lack of ceremony
with which it has been necessary to act.
I would say to the House,
as I said to those who have joined the government:
I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.
